# Moose

**Moose** (*Mock Observation Of Synchrotron Emission*) is a Julia toolkit for
turning magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation data into synthetic radio
observations. It reads cartesian or HEALPix simulation fields and produces
reproducible FITS products for synchrotron and Faraday analysis.

## Main features

- Compute synchrotron Stokes **I**, **Q**, and **U** cubes.
- Include Faraday rotation, instrumental filtering, and noise.
- Perform RM synthesis, RMSF diagnostics, and RM-CLEAN deconvolution.
- Fit physical Faraday models to Q/U spectra and compare them with AIC/BIC.
- Produce rotation-measure, spectral-index, polarization-fraction, and
  polarization-gradient maps.
- Compute structure functions and polarization diagnostics.
- Process cartesian FITS/HDF5, leaf-cell AMR HDF5, and HEALPix FITS data.
- Process large datasets in tiles to reduce memory use.
- Run interactively, from a JSON configuration, or through the Python wrapper.

Moose makes it possible to build mock radio-observation pipelines from MHD
simulations, compare simulated polarization with observations, study Faraday
depth structure and turbulence, and export analysis-ready products with
configuration and provenance metadata.

## Installation

Moose requires [Julia 1.10 or later](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Clone the repository, enter its directory, and install the dependencies:

```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

Check the installation without input data:

```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project -e 'using Moose; run_moose(help=true)'
```

## Usage

Start the interactive workflow:

```julia
using Moose
run_moose()
```

Run an existing JSON configuration non-interactively:

```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project src/MOOSE_cli.jl /path/to/config.json --quiet
```

A template is available at `config/default_config.json`. The Python wrapper
provides the same command-line workflow:

```bash
python3 python/moose_frontend.py --config /path/to/config.json --quiet
```

To validate the complete pipeline with analytically known data:

```julia
using Moose
demo = make_demo_data("moose_demo")
MOOSE_from_config(demo.config_path; quiet=true)
```

Results are written as FITS files alongside the selected simulation. Each run
also records its configuration, provenance, and timing in `MOOSE_summary.log`.

### AMR inputs

MOOSE accepts AMR leaf cells stored in HDF5 and conservatively rasterizes each
intensive field onto the regular output grid. Configure the physical fields as
HDF5 datasets and add a shared `amr` geometry entry:

```json
"field_sources": {
  "Bx":          {"path": "amr.h5", "dataset": "cells/Bx"},
  "By":          {"path": "amr.h5", "dataset": "cells/By"},
  "Bz":          {"path": "amr.h5", "dataset": "cells/Bz"},
  "density":     {"path": "amr.h5", "dataset": "cells/density"},
  "temperature": {"path": "amr.h5", "dataset": "cells/temperature"},
  "amr": {
    "file": "amr.h5",
    "x": "cells/x", "y": "cells/y", "z": "cells/z",
    "size": "cells/dx",
    "bounds": [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1]],
    "shape": [256, 256, 256]
  }
}
```

`size` may contain one width per cell or three axis widths. Alternatively use
`"level": "cells/level"`; a level `l` has width `domain_size / 2^l` (use
`level_offset` when levels are numbered relative to another root). Inputs must
contain leaf cells only. By default MOOSE rejects gaps and overlaps; set
`"strict": false` only for intentionally partial domains. AMR currently uses
the in-memory path and is therefore incompatible with `tile_size`.
