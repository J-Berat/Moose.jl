# MOOSE.jl — From an MHD cube to synthetic Faraday tomography

*A hands-on, reactive tutorial for **MOOSE** (Mock Observation Of Synchrotron Emission), a Julia
toolkit that turns magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation cubes into synthetic polarized radio
observations: Stokes $Q$/$U$ cubes, Faraday rotation, instrumental effects, RM synthesis and
RM‑CLEAN.*

**Audience.** This notebook assumes you already know the basics of MHD and of linear
polarization (Stokes parameters, Faraday rotation), but have never used MOOSE before. It is meant
to be read top to bottom, but every section is also self-contained enough to revisit later.

**How to read this notebook.** Every code cell below calls a *real* function that exists in the
current MOOSE source tree (`src/`) — nothing is invented. Functions that are part of MOOSE's
stable, exported API are called directly (`RMSynthesisAuto(...)`); functions that exist and are
documented but are not re-exported from the `Moose` module (e.g. low-level physics one-liners
such as `Bperp`, `IntrinsicAngle`, `deltaRM`) are called with an explicit `Moose.` prefix, exactly
as MOOSE's own regression test suite (`test/runtests.jl`) does.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:

- load or build a test physical cube (density, electron density, temperature, magnetic field);
- choose a line of sight and understand MOOSE's axis convention;
- compute the intermediate observables: the projected magnetic field, the intrinsic polarization
  angle, the Faraday depth;
- produce synthetic Stokes $Q(\nu)$, $U(\nu)$ and combine them into a polarized intensity;
- apply realistic instrumental effects (noise, spatial filtering) with real MOOSE functions;
- run an RM synthesis and an RM‑CLEAN, and interpret the resulting Faraday dispersion function
  (FDF);
- validate the whole pipeline against a known analytic case, including the demonstration harness
  officially shipped with MOOSE (`make_demo_data`);
- run the full end-to-end pipeline through `MOOSE_from_config` and read back the resulting FITS
  products;
- understand the memory/compute cost of the pipeline and how to scale it to a real simulation.

# 1. Installation and getting started

MOOSE is a regular Julia package (not yet registered in the general registry), organized like any
Julia repository: `Project.toml` at the root, source code in `src/`, tests in `test/`. This
notebook lives in `notebooks/MOOSE_tutorial.jl`, next to the package.

### Launching this notebook

```bash
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("Pluto"); using Pluto; Pluto.run()'
```
then, in the Pluto interface that opens in your browser, open the file
`notebooks/MOOSE_tutorial.jl`.

### Loading MOOSE from this notebook

Pluto normally manages its own reproducible per-notebook Julia environment (the
`PLUTO_PROJECT_TOML_CONTENTS` / `PLUTO_MANIFEST_TOML_CONTENTS` blocks that Pluto automatically
appends on save). That machinery is designed for **registered** packages: it has no way to locate
an unregistered local package such as `Moose`. The standard, non-destructive approach for a
tutorial notebook that lives *inside* the package repository is to activate a temporary Julia
environment, *develop* the local package into it with `Pkg.develop`, and add the handful of
interface packages the notebook itself needs (`PlutoUI`):

- `Pkg.activate(temp = true)` creates a brand-new, empty Julia environment, isolated from any
  other project on the machine — **nothing** is written to MOOSE's own `Project.toml`/
  `Manifest.toml`: the operation is non-destructive.
- `Pkg.develop(path = ...)` adds MOOSE to this temporary environment by pointing directly at the
  repository's source code (no copy, no pinned version).
- `Pkg.add([...])` adds the packages used only by the notebook itself.

The next cell does all of this. It may take about a minute the first time (dependency resolution),
then is essentially instant on subsequent runs.

!!! note "run_moose() is not executed in this notebook"
    `run_moose()` is MOOSE's interactive command-line entry point: it asks questions on `stdin`
    (which dataset to process, line of sight, frequencies, ...). That would block a Pluto cell
    forever (Pluto has no interactive terminal). For programmatic/reproducible use — exactly what
    a notebook needs — MOOSE provides two non-interactive entry points that we use throughout:
    `make_demo_data` to generate a toy dataset with known analytic results, and
    `MOOSE_from_config` to run the full pipeline from a JSON configuration dictionary. This is
    also what `MOOSE_cli.jl` does on the command line
    (`julia --project src/MOOSE_cli.jl config.json --quiet`).

# 2. MOOSE's scientific pipeline

MOOSE turns a cube of physical fields into synthetic radio observables through a well-defined
chain of steps. Each arrow below corresponds to one or more real MOOSE functions that we will call
explicitly later in this notebook (indicated in parentheses).

This notebook follows this chain section by section, using two datasets in parallel:

1. a **pedagogical cube** that we build ourselves (§3), used to illustrate the geometry, the
   projected field, and the Faraday depth with MOOSE functions called directly on arrays;
2. **MOOSE's official demonstration dataset** (`make_demo_data`, §3 and §15-16), run through the
   real `MOOSE_from_config` pipeline — the only honest way to exercise the "synchrotron
   emissivity → Q/U" step without guessing the internal conventions of the emissivity table.

    MOOSE's geometry and formulas with physically reasonable numbers for the diffuse interstellar

# 5. Line-of-sight geometry

MOOSE never implicitly assumes an axis convention: the public (non-exported) function
`Moose.los_basis` is **the** single source of truth for the mapping between the cube's cartesian
components `(Ax, Ay, Az)` and the (sky plane ⊕ line-of-sight) frame `(A1, A2, ALOS)`. It is a
cyclic permutation with determinant +1 (it preserves chirality, hence the sign of the intrinsic
polarization angle defined later):

```julia
los_basis(Ax, Ay, Az, "z") == (Ax, Ay, Az)
los_basis(Ax, Ay, Az, "x") == (Ay, Az, Ax)
los_basis(Ax, Ay, Az, "y") == (Az, Ax, Ay)
```

Once the components are relabelled, MOOSE also reorders the cube's **pixel axes** with
`Moose.permute_dims(array, LOS)` so that array axis 3 is always the integration axis, whatever
`LOS` is. This is exactly, in this order, what `ReadSimulation` does internally
(`src/FileIO/ReadSimulation.jl`); we reproduce this composition identically.

### Line-of-sight geometry used by the mock screens

```text
one screen:
observer  ←  Faraday screen φ₁  ←  polarized synchrotron background

two screens:
observer  ←  screen φ₂  ←  synchrotron layer  ←  screen φ₁  ←  distant background
              sees φ₂             sees φ₁ + φ₂
```

The arrows point in the propagation direction toward the observer. Faraday screens rotate
polarization but do not emit in these mock geometries.

# 9. Projected field and intrinsic polarization angle

The magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight and the intrinsic polarization angle are

internal conventions:

```math
B_\perp = \sqrt{B_1^2 + B_2^2} \qquad \text{(Moose.Bperp)}

```math
\psi_{\rm src} = \operatorname{atan2}(B_2, B_1) + \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad \text{(Moose.IntrinsicAngle)}

The $\pi/2$ offset encodes the classic synchrotron property: the intrinsic polarization E-vector
is **perpendicular** to the projected magnetic field, not parallel to it. `ψ_src` (the *intrinsic*
angle, before Faraday rotation) is therefore genuinely different from the geometric orientation
angle of `B⊥` itself, $\theta_B = \operatorname{atan2}(B_2, B_1)$.

# 10. Faraday depth

MOOSE computes Faraday rotation cell by cell with `Moose.deltaRM`, then integrates it along the
line of sight with a cumulative sum via `Moose.RM` — **exactly** as `ProcessSynchrotron.jl` does
internally (`dRM = deltaRM(BLOS, ne, PixelLength_pc); RMcube = RM(dRM)`):

```math
\Delta\phi_k = 0.81\;
\left(\frac{n_e}{\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}\right)_k
\left(\frac{B_{\rm LOS}}{\mu\mathrm{G}}\right)_k
\left(\frac{\Delta l}{\mathrm{pc}}\right)
\ \ \mathrm{rad\,m^{-2}}, \qquad
\phi(l) = \sum_{k'=1}^{k} \Delta\phi_{k'}.
```

The coefficient `0.81` is the constant `Moose.RM_PREFACTOR` (module
`PhysicalParameters/Constants.jl`, in µG⁻¹ pc⁻¹ cm⁻³) — we do not re-guess it, we read it directly
from the code.

- **Uniform B_LOS** isolates the effect of *spatial fluctuations* of the projected magnetic field

!!! warning "Faraday depth ≠ observed rotation measure"
    `φ(l)`, the *cumulative* Faraday depth, is a function of position along the line of sight: it
    is a 3D quantity. The **observed rotation measure** is a single number per line of sight,
    measured by fitting $\chi(\lambda^2) = \chi_0 + \mathrm{RM}\,\lambda^2$ to the data — it
    coincides with `φ_total = φ(l_{max})` only in the idealized case of a **Faraday-thin** medium
    (the emitter and the rotating medium are separate, as in MOOSE's demonstration dataset,
    §15). If emission and rotation are mixed along the line of sight (Faraday-thick), the fitted
    RM can differ significantly from `φ(l_max)`, or even lose its meaning: this is exactly what
    the Faraday dispersion function `F(φ)` (§14) lets you diagnose.

# 11. Synchrotron emission and Stokes parameters

The full computation of synchrotron emissivity (`Moose.EmissInterp`, `Moose.QUnu3D`,
`Moose.Tnu3D`) integrates the Padovani & Galli (2018/2021) equation over a relativistic electron
spectrum and interpolates a `(B, ν) → (ε_∥, ε_⊥)` table. This is the real internal machinery
actually invoked by `MOOSE_from_config` (§16) — we do not reconstruct it by hand here (that would
require guessing the exact convention of the internal spline table, which the instructions for
this notebook explicitly ask us to avoid).

For this pedagogical cube, we therefore use the **closed-form Faraday-thin model** — the very same
one documented and validated by MOOSE's official demonstration dataset, `make_demo_data`
(`src/SyntheticObservations/DemoData.jl`):

```math
T_\nu(x,y) = T_0 \cdot \frac{B_\perp(x,y)}{\langle B_\perp\rangle}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_0}\right)^{\alpha}
\qquad
Q_\nu + iU_\nu = p_0\, T_\nu \, e^{2i\left(\psi_{\rm src}(x,y) + \phi(x,y)\,\lambda^2\right)}
```

with `α` the spectral index, `p₀` the intrinsic polarization fraction, `ψ_src` and `φ` computed in
§9-10 by the real functions `Moose.IntrinsicAngle`/`Moose.RM`. This is a "closed-box" model: it
**spatially generalizes** the single-screen model of `make_demo_data`, it does not invent any new
physics.

# 12. Instrumental effects

MOOSE provides two public instrumental effects, applied in this order by `ProcessSynchrotron.jl`
when `responseSynchrotron = "Y"` / `add_noise = "Y"` in the configuration:

1. **Interferometric spatial filtering** — a hard Fourier mask that removes scales larger than
   `Llarge` (the interferometer cannot see the most extended structures) and smaller than the
   Nyquist limit, with the public functions
   `Moose.instrument_bandpass_L`/`Moose.apply_to_array_xy`. MOOSE does **not** provide a Gaussian
   beam convolution function for cartesian cubes in its current public API (only the HEALPix
   branch exposes `healpix_smooth`, see §19): `beam_fwhm_pix` below therefore controls `Llarge`
   (largest spatial scale retained, in pixels), not a PSF width.
2. **Gaussian noise on Q, U** — calibrated to reach the polarized signal-to-noise ratio `SNR_nu`
   per channel: `σ = P_{\rm rms}/\mathrm{SNR}_\nu` with `P_{\rm rms} = \sqrt{\langle
   Q^2\rangle + \langle U^2\rangle}`, exactly the formula documented by MOOSE's internal function
   `_add_noise!` (reimplemented here pedagogically since it is private, not exported).

MOOSE always applies the filtering to **Q and U before** recomputing the polarized intensity `P`
(never the other way around): this is the order imposed by `ProcessSynchrotron.jl`, which we
follow.

    Turn on `noise_on` alone: the residual is centered white noise, mean depolarization stays
    close to 1 (noise does not bias `⟨P⟩` on average but increases its scatter). Turn on
    `beam_on` alone with a small `beam_fwhm_pix`: the band-pass filter removes large scales, which
    can *reduce* `P` where the polarization structure varies on scales close to `Llarge`
    (depolarization from mixing different polarization angles within the synthesized beam — the
    effect is visible even on this cube where `Q,U` vary spatially, unlike MOOSE's purely uniform

# 13. RM synthesis and RMSF

MOOSE implements rotation-measure synthesis as defined by Brentjens & de Bruyn (2005):

```math
F(\phi) = K \sum_j w_j\, P(\lambda_j^2)\, \exp\!\big[-2i\,\phi\,(\lambda_j^2 - \lambda_0^2)\big],
\qquad K = \frac{1}{N_\lambda},\quad \lambda_0^2 = K\sum_j \lambda_j^2.
```

This is exactly the formula implemented by `RMSynthesis`/`RMSynthesisAuto` (uniform weights
`w_j = 1`, `K = 1/N_λ`) — **with the `-2i` sign**, verified in the code rather than assumed: this
is the convention used in `src/Faraday/RMSynthesis.jl`. `λ₀²` is the weighted mean of `λ²` over the
observed band. The public function `rmsf_diagnostics` computes both the complex RMSF and its
characteristic resolutions: the measured full width at half maximum `fwhm`, the analytic estimate
`fwhm_theoretical = 2√3/Δλ²`, the maximum detectable depth `phi_max` (related to the channel width
in `λ²`) and the maximum Faraday-thick scale `max_scale = π/λ²_min`.

# 15. Analytic validation cases

Two independent validations: configurable mock polarized data built from synchrotron backgrounds
and Faraday screens, followed by MOOSE's **real** official demonstration harness end to end.

## 15.1 — Synchrotron background and Faraday screens

Choose between two physically explicit geometries:

1. **one screen:** a polarized synchrotron background behind one non-emitting Faraday screen;
2. **two screens:** a distant synchrotron background behind both screens, plus polarized
   synchrotron emission between them. The observer therefore sees components at
   ``\phi_2`` and ``\phi_1+\phi_2``.

!!! note "Why emission is needed between two screens"
    Two non-emitting screens in front of a single background only produce the cumulative rotation
    ``\phi_1+\phi_2`` and are observationally equivalent to one screen. Emission between the
    screens is what makes the two Faraday depths separately visible to RM synthesis.

```math
P(\lambda^2)=Q+iU=\sum_k p_k\exp\!\left[2i\left(\chi_k+\phi_k\lambda^2\right)\right].
```

The one-screen case is exactly the `:screen` model of `Moose.qu_model`. The two-screen case is a
linear superposition of two Faraday-thin synchrotron components and is passed through the same
MOOSE RM-synthesis chain.

### Truth, dirty FDF and RM-CLEAN

The injected Faraday spectrum is a set of delta components. RM synthesis returns that truth
convolved with the RMSF; RM-CLEAN estimates a sparse component model and restores it with the RMSF
main lobe. For two screens we monitor

```math
\Delta\phi=|\phi_a-\phi_b|,\qquad
\mathcal R_\phi=\frac{\Delta\phi}{\mathrm{FWHM}_{\mathrm{RMSF}}}.
```

The labels *unresolved*, *partially resolved* and *clearly resolved* below are practical
RMSF-based diagnostics, not universal detection theorems. The amplitude ratio and SNR also matter.

Finite channel width is evaluated by numerical integration in frequency inside each channel. For
a narrow channel this approaches the familiar attenuation
``\operatorname{sinc}(2\phi\,\Delta\lambda^2)``.

# 17. Guided interpretation

A few experiments to run by manipulating the widgets already defined, before reading the
collapsible answers below.

- **Line-of-sight orientation** (`los_choice`, §4): with a tilted mean field (`Bangle_deg` ≠
  0/90°), compare `x`, `y`, `z`. A line of sight closer to the mean-field direction reduces `B⊥`
  (hence synchrotron emission) but **increases** `B_LOS` (hence Faraday rotation): an unavoidable
  geometric trade-off.
- **`B_LOS` amplitude** (via `Bangle_deg`/`B0_uG`, §3): `Δφ ∝ B_LOS` (linear, `Moose.deltaRM`) —
  doubling `B0_uG` at the same angle roughly doubles `RMmap_toy` everywhere.
- **Electron density** (`ne0_cm3`, `ionfrac`, §3): same thing, `Δφ ∝ nₑ` linearly.
- **Bandwidth** (`nu_min_MHz`/`nu_max_MHz`, §4): widening the frequency band widens the `λ²`
  coverage, which **sharpens** the RMSF (`diag.fwhm` decreases) but reduces the detectable
  `φ_max` (individual channels are wider in `λ²` at a fixed low frequency).
- **Number of channels** (`n_channels`): at fixed bandwidth, more channels barely change the RMSF
  (which depends on the total `Δλ²`, not the number of points), but reduces `δλ²` per channel,
  hence increases `φ_max` (the largest scale not affected by aliasing).
- **Noise** (`noise_on`/`snr_level`, §12): degrades `P` randomly but without bias on average
  (`Moose.RMS` of the residual increases, the depolarization map stays centered on 1).
- **Spatial filtering** (`beam_on`/`beam_fwhm_pix`, §12): removes large scales; can depolarize if
  the polarization angle varies over the filtered scales.
- **Mock Faraday geometry** (§15): compare one screen with two screens. In the two-screen case,
  reduce `|φ_screen_1|` until the two expected depths approach the RMSF FWHM; the peaks then blend
  and cease to be independently resolvable.

### Turbulence diagnostic: structure function of the Faraday map

`structure_function` (exported) estimates `SF(r) = ⟨[X(x) − X(x+r)]²⟩` by random sampling of pixel
pairs (fast, robust to `NaN`) — applied here to `RMmap_toy` (§10), its power-law slope informs on
the turbulent cascade that produced the rotation-measure map.

# ╔═╡ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000001197
details("1. Why can a line of sight perpendicular to the mean field reduce the Faraday depth?",
	md"`Moose.deltaRM` only depends on `B_LOS`, the projection of the field *onto* the line of sight. If the line of sight is perpendicular to the mean field, `B_LOS` comes only from turbulent fluctuations (generally weaker than the mean component), so `|φ_total|` decreases — even though `B⊥` (and hence synchrotron emission) is then maximal.")

# ╔═╡ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000001198
details("2. How does the width of the λ² band affect the RMSF?",
	md"According to `Moose.rmsf_diagnostics`, the analytic full width at half maximum is `fwhm_theoretical = 2√3/Δλ²`: the larger `Δλ² = λ²_max - λ²_min` (wide band, or low minimum frequency), the narrower the RMSF, hence the better the Faraday-depth resolution.")

# ╔═╡ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000001199
details("3. Why doesn't the maximum of |F(φ)| always represent a single physical layer?",
	md"The dirty F(φ) is the true Faraday dispersion function *convolved* with the RMSF, which has significant sidelobes under incomplete λ² sampling. A maximum can therefore be a sidelobe artifact, the superposition of several nearby Faraday-thin components, or a continuous Faraday-thick medium whose peak corresponds to no precise physical layer. RM-CLEAN (`RMClean`/`RMCleanAuto`) removes the RMSF's lobes but cannot, by itself, distinguish a Faraday-thick source from a set of thin sources.")

# ╔═╡ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000001200
details("4. Why must the beam (filtering) be applied to Q and U before computing P?",
	md"P = √(Q²+U²) is a nonlinear operation (because of noise and the implicit absolute value, somewhat like Rician bias). Filtering/averaging Q and U separately preserves their linearity (and hence the vector-addition properties of polarization); filtering P directly would incorrectly mix different polarization angles. This is the order applied by `ProcessSynchrotron.jl` and reproduced in §12.")

# ╔═╡ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000001201
details("5. Under what conditions is a Faraday-thick structure strongly depolarized?",
	md"When Faraday rotation varies significantly *within* the emitting region (dispersion `σ_RM λ⁴` large compared to 1, cf. the `:external_dispersion`/`:internal_dispersion` models of `Moose.qu_model`), polarization vectors at different depths partially cancel when integrated: this is internal differential depolarization, distinct from the instrumental depolarization of §12.")

# 18. Performance and best practices

**Memory cost.** The Faraday cube `F(x,y,φ)` by far dominates this notebook's memory: it occupies
`3 × nx × ny × nφ × 8` bytes (`|F|`, `Re F`, `Im F`, in `Float64`). §13 displays this estimate
*before* launching the computation and warns above 1 GiB (without blocking, per this notebook's
instructions). The Q/U cubes (`nx × ny × nν`) and the MHD input (5-8 cubes `nx × ny × nz`) are
generally much smaller.

**Effect of `N`, the number of channels, and the number of Faraday depths.** The cost of
`RMSynthesis` grows as `nx·ny·nφ·nν` (a block matrix product over depths, see
`_rmsynthesis_mul!` in `src/Faraday/RMSynthesis.jl`): doubling `N` (hence `nx·ny` ×4),
`n_channels`, or the number of Faraday depths (`(phi_max-phi_min)/dphi`) has a direct multiplicative
effect.

**Shrinking the test case.** `cube_N` (§3) is deliberately limited to {24, 32, 48, 64}: this is
enough to see the whole physics (filaments, turbulence, RM synthesis, RM-CLEAN) in a few seconds.
To explore faster, reduce `n_channels` and narrow `[phi_min, phi_max]`/increase `dphi` rather than
`cube_N` (the cost of RM synthesis is more sensitive to `nφ·nν` than to `N²` at the sizes
considered here).

**Avoiding unnecessary allocations.** MOOSE avoids repeated allocations in its hot loops: for
example `_rmsynthesis_mul!` groups Faraday depths into blocks of 64 to turn matrix-vector products
(BLAS level 2) into matrix-matrix products (BLAS level 3, much more efficient), and
`spectral_index_map`/`polarization_gradient_map` reuse views (`@view`) rather than copies.

**Multithreaded functions.** `Moose.spectral_index_map` explicitly uses `Threads.@threads` over
pixels (visible in `src/Statistics/SpectralIndex.jl`): launch Julia with several threads (`julia
--project --threads=auto`) to benefit from this. RM synthesis itself (`RMSynthesis`) is not
multithreaded but relies on multithreaded BLAS for its matrix products.

**`Float32`.** MOOSE accepts input cubes in `Float32` (see the comment in `Moose.IntrinsicAngle`
about type promotion): this halves the memory of the input cubes and of the Stokes Q/U/T, at the
cost of reduced precision — relevant for large simulations, not necessary at the scale of this
notebook.

**Moving to a real simulation.** The most important parameter for total compute time is the size
of the input MHD cube (`box.npix` in the JSON configuration): MOOSE provides a "tiled" mode
(`tile_size` in the configuration) that processes the cube in slices to keep memory bounded for
large simulations (see `src/Synchrotron/TiledProcessing.jl`), incompatible with instrumental
filtering and noise (which need the full sky plane — see the explicit error messages of
`MOOSE_from_config` cited in §5).

# 19. Using real data

## 19.1 — Cartesian: `field_sources`, FITS/HDF5, AMR

To process a real simulation instead of the pedagogical cube of §3, MOOSE reads the required
fields (`Bx, By, Bz, density, temperature`, plus optionally `Vx, Vy, Vz, densityH2, densityHp`)
from FITS or HDF5 files listed under the `field_sources` key of a JSON configuration (see
`config/default_config.json` in the repository), using the real non-interactive entry point:

```julia
using Moose
MOOSE_from_config("/path/to/config.json"; quiet = true)
```

MOOSE also accepts AMR grids (HDF5 leaf cells, rasterized onto the output grid — see the
repository's README for the full `amr` schema) and only requires `field_sources` when the file
names do not follow the default convention (`Bx.fits`, `By.fits`, ... in the simulation folder).

This notebook depends on no machine-specific absolute path: the two fields below are **optional**
and are used only if you explicitly click the load button.

`RMSynthesisAuto`/`RMCleanAuto` automatically detect whether `Q`/`U` are cartesian grids or

synthetic sky (`nside = 2`, 48 pixels), with the same closed-form Faraday-thin model as in

!!! note "Methodological note"
    The requested threshold of 70% coverage of scientifically useful public functions is
    substantially exceeded for the exported API. The functions not used are so for precise,
    documented reasons above: incompatibility with Pluto's non-interactive execution (`stdin`
    prompts), redundancy with an already-demonstrated higher-level function, disproportionate
    compute cost for a reactive notebook, or the corresponding feature being absent from the
    current version of the repository (HI multiphase).
